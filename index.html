                    Hello! I am a graduating student at the University of Maryland College Park. I am very excited about emerging technologies.
                    I want to be able to take the knowledge and concepts I have learned in school and apply them to solve
                    real world problems. I am excited about gaining experience and exposure in technology.

            <h3>Technical Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <i>Bank of America</i>
                <li>Updated PowerShell automation script to validate if source code files for an updated ATM solution from a
                    vendor’s delivery matched the software components promised by the vendor in their Release Manifest.</li>
                <li>Obtained, manipulated, and extracted information from different COM objects with different cmdlets, created
                    two custom iDictionary data structures and a custom PSObject, implemented O(n) algorithm for comparison,
                    piped comparison output and forensic audit detail to text file to be referenced at any time.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <i>Pismo</i>
                <li>Worked speaking only in Portuguese. Learned the implementation of the Pismo gateway repo, which is based
                    on Netflix’s zuul-gateway and is responsible for routing users to their appropriate microservice, each
                    having their own database subsystem.</li>
                <li>Updated the CanarayReleaseFilter file with java and groovy to extract and check headers using the zuul api,
                    check environment variables, and log information. Ran repo on localhost, used Insomnia REST Client to
                    create custom HTTP requests (to be routed to new version of a microservice), and viewed entire transaction
                    for testing purposes. Created unit tests for testing. Familiarized with Jenkins and Docker.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <i>Paradyme Management Inc.</i>
                <li>Created resume parser with python, used word2vec for word vectorization, used Scikit-Learn and NLTK libraries.
                    Labeled words, tested Naïve Bayes and Support vector machine objects for skills extraction.</li>
                <li>Used Beautiful Soup for web scraping to create CSV of 4k majors and another CSV of 5k Universities. Used
                    different matching techniques, checked unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, as well as use simple regex.</li>
